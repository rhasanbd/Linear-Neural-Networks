# Linear Neural Networks

If github in unable to render a Jupyter notebook, copy the link of the notebook and enter into the nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/


These notebooks provide an introduction to Linear Neural Networks (LNNs). a LNN can learn only linear functions using a single layer of neuron(s). We create LNNs for solving binary and multi-class classification problems.

- Binary Clasification: the logistic regression technique is casted as a LNN model with a single neuron

- Multi-class Classification: the softmax regression technique is casted as a LNN model with multiple neurons in layer. The number of neurons is equal to the number of classes.

Following is brief description of the notebooks.

- Notebook 1: Logistic regression as LNN for binary classification (linearly separable data)

- Notebook 2: Logistic regression as LNN for binary classification (linearly non-separable data)

- Notebook 3: Softmax regression as LNN for multi-class classification
